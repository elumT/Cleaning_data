The repository contains files for the final project of the course "Getting and cleaning data". 

The run_analisys.R does the following:

1. Downloads the data
2. Reads downloaded files and appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5. Reads activity names
6. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
7. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The file tidy_data.txt contains the final dataset.
The file Codebook.txt contains description of variables in the tidy_data.txt.
